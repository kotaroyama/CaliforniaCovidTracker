# California COVID Tracker

## Motivation
I wanted to try out [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). I also wanted something that can visualize daily fluctuations in the number of new cases in the State of California. Data is retrieved from [California Department of Public Health](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-time-series-metrics-by-county-and-state/resource/046cdd2b-31e5-4d34-9ed3-b48cdbc4be7a).

## What it does
  - Retrieves the total number of covid cases in California. 
  - Plots the graph starting from March to Today using Matplotlib.

## Tasks
  - Tweets out the number daily using Tweepy.
  - Make the plots look better

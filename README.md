# California COVID Twitter Bot

## Motivation
I wanted to try out [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/). I also wanted something that can visualize daily fluctuations in the number of new cases in the State of California. Data is retrieved from [California Open Data Portal](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-cases)

## What it does
  - Retrieves the total number of covid cases in California. 
  - Plots the graph starting from March to Today using Matplotlib.
  - Tweets out the number daily using Tweepy.

## Tasks
  - Make the plots look better
